# Camera Shuffle ðŸ“· ðŸ”€

## Description

This project is a fun experiment with the [View Transitions API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transitions_API) and the [getUserMedia() method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getUserMedia). It aims to explore the capabilities of these APIs to create smooth transitions and access media devices. This project is built using Vite and React.
